# Create Resume with AI

Hi user,

Do you always struggle with the ATS (Applicant Tracking System) when applying for jobs?

Do you get low scores on ATS tests and don't know why?

This project helps you fix that.

## What it does

* You write your resume sections normally
* You provide the job description you're applying for
* The site extracts key phrases that ATS systems look for
* It suggests how to include them in your resume in a natural, optimized way

It works for:

* Summary
* Work experience
* Skills

This increases your ATS score and gives your resume a better chance of passing automatic filters.

## Features

* Auto keyword suggestions based on job description
* Grammar correction for resume text
* Convert casual language into professional resume format
* Multi-step resume builder (summary, education, experience, skills, etc.)
* Save each section separately using API calls
* Download your resume as a PDF

## Technologies used

* ReactJS (Vite)
* React Router DOM
* React Query (TanStack)
* TailwindCSS for styling
* Supabase for backend and authentication
* `useForm` for form handling
* `react-to-print` to export the final resume as a PDF
* Gemini AI for keyword extraction and text transformation

## PDF Result

After completing your resume, you can download a professional PDF version directly from the site.Example:

## ATS Score

To pass most ATS filters, your resume usually needs to score **at least 80%**.

This project helps you reach or exceed that by:

* Matching your resume content with the job description
* Highlighting missing keywords
* Improving language and formatting

## Notes

* This is a **beta version**
* Focused on helping developers build technical resumes
* Not yet tested for other fields ðŸ™‚
* You donâ€™t have to use this site to apply for jobs
* The goal is to help you **learn how to structure your resume** and **arrange content the right way** to get a higher ATS score
